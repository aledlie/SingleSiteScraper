```html
<!-- Minimal HTML head section -->
<head>

    <meta name="google-site-verification" content="basic-verification-code">
    <title>Basic Title</title>
</head>
```

**Problems Identified:**

### Search Engine Understanding
- **Content Type Recognition**: Poor - Search engines had to guess what the application does
- **Feature Discovery**: None - No structured way to communicate application capabilities
- **Rich Results**: Not eligible for any enhanced search features
- **Social Sharing**: Basic link previews with generic information
