# 📊 SingleSiteScraper Database - Business Overview

## What This System Does
Our web scraping system analyzes websites and stores four main types of information:

---

## 🏢 Business Data Tables

### 1. 📈 **Website Performance Data** (`performance_metrics`)
**What it tracks**: How fast and efficiently websites load

**Key Information**:
- Which webpage was tested
- How long it took to load (in milliseconds)  
- How many times we had to retry failed requests
- Size of the webpage content
- When the test was performed

**Business Value**: 
- Identify slow-loading pages that hurt user experience
- Monitor website performance over time
- Optimize pages that are taking too long to load

**Real Example**: 
*"The homepage took 3.2 seconds to load, which is above our 2-second target. We should optimize the images and reduce the number of external scripts."*

---

### 2. 🏷️ **Structured Content Metadata** (`schema_org_data`)  
**What it tracks**: Special markup that helps search engines understand content

**Key Information**:
- Type of content (Article, Product, Organization, etc.)
- Detailed information about each content item
- Which webpage it came from
- When it was discovered

**Business Value**:
- Improve search engine rankings with rich snippets
- Ensure content is properly structured for SEO
- Track what types of content we're publishing

**Real Example**:
*"We found Article markup on 75% of our blog posts, but only 30% of our product pages have Product markup. We should add structured data to more product pages to improve e-commerce SEO."*

---

### 3. 📊 **Visual Chart Definitions** (`html_graphs`)
**What it tracks**: Overall analysis of webpage structure and complexity

**Key Information**:
- Which webpage was analyzed
- How many elements (buttons, images, text blocks) were found
- How complex the page structure is (0-10 scale)
- When the analysis happened

**Business Value**:
- Identify overly complex pages that may confuse users
- Understand page structure for optimization
- Track changes in page complexity over time

**Real Example**:
*"Our checkout page has a complexity score of 8.5/10, which may be why users are abandoning their carts. We should simplify the checkout process."*

---

### 4. 🧩 **Web Page Elements** (`html_objects`)
**What it tracks**: Individual components found on each webpage

**Key Information**:
- Type of element (navigation, content, header, footer, etc.)
- What HTML tag it uses (button, image, paragraph, etc.)
- Its role on the page (main content, sidebar, etc.)
- Any text content it contains

**Business Value**:
- Understand how content is organized on pages
- Identify missing elements (like contact information)
- Ensure consistent page structure across the site

**Real Example**:
*"We discovered that 40% of our product pages are missing breadcrumb navigation, which could hurt user experience and SEO."*

## 🔗 How The Data Connects

```
Website Analysis Session
       ↓
Performance Data ← → Page Structure Analysis
                          ↓
                    Individual Elements + Structured Content
```

**Simple Explanation**: 
1. We analyze a webpage and record how well it performs
2. We break down the page structure and measure its complexity  
3. We identify every element on the page and extract any special SEO markup
4. All this data is connected so we can see the complete picture of each webpage
